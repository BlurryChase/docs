Nothing really... but in a good way. This means that bundles can be migrated over to v2 with little to no changes required. This update is more about making it easier for NodeCG core developers to develop new features that you can use in the future.\\n\\nPlease refer to the [migration docs](/docs/migrating/migrating-1.x-to-2.x) for more information and if you need any help please don\'t hesitate to reach out to the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GJ4r8a8)!\\n\\n## TypeScript rewrite {#typescript}\\n\\nThe biggest and most important change for NodeCG is that it is now written in TypeScript. This will greatly benefit developers of NodeCG core and also allow bundle developers to more easily use types through the `@nodecg/types` package.\\n\\n## NodeCG repository now contains only source code {#build}\\n\\nNodeCG used to contain its build outputs in the repository. This was helpful at the time, since all that was needed was to install the dependencies and you were off to the races. However, in v2 this has changed. If you use `nodecg-cli`, make sure to download the latest version in order for v2 to install correctly (`npm i -g nodecg-cli@latest`). Developers who would clone manually must now install all dependencies (`npm i`) and run `npm run build` themselves.\\n\\n## Running into issues? {#issues}\\n\\nIf you are having any issues at all with version 2, please post an [issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg/issues) or reach out to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GJ4r8a8).\\n\\n## Future {#future}\\n\\nNodeCG waiting to be rewritten in TypeScript was a major blocker for new developments to the project. It was also a massive undertaking, which is why it took so long to develop.\\n\\nNow that it\'s written in TypeScript we can start developing new features that have been long requested such as:\\n\\n- Per-user permissions\\n- Reworked project structure\\n- Better bundle management\\n- Internationalization\\n- Updating the dashboard UI to React (will not affect bundles, just the internal code of the dashboard. You will never be forced to write your bundles in any specific framework.)\\n- and more!\\n\\n## Thanks to {#thanks}\\n\\n- [Lange](https://github.com/alvancamp) for lead development of v2\\n- [Keiichiro Amemiya](https://github.com/Hoishin) for assisting in direction and development of v2\\n- [zoton2](https://github.com/zoton2) for testing & feedback\\n- [Ewan Lyon](https://github.com/EwanLyon) for testing & feedback\\n- [Daniel](https://github.com/daniel0611) for testing & feedback\\n- [Dan Shields](https://github.com/Dan-Shields) for fixes & feedback\\n- [Jon Egeland](https://github.com/faultyserver) for major contributions to the architecture of the code\\n- [Dom Hynes](https://github.com/DomHynes) for fixes & feedback\\n- The NodeCG community for their patience and support during this time"},{"id":"/2020/02/26/New-Docs","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/02/26/New-Docs","source":"@site/blog/2020-02-26-New-Docs.md","title":"New Docs!","description":"Docusaurus goes roar!","date":"2020-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"26 f\xe9vrier 2020","tags":[{"label":"update","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/update"},{"label":"docs","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/docs"}],"readingTime":0.43,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ewan Lyon","url":"https://github.com/EwanLyon","imageURL":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19513845?s=460&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"New Docs!","author":"Ewan Lyon","author_url":"https://github.com/EwanLyon","author_image_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19513845?s=460&v=4","tags":["update","docs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"NodeCG v2!","permalink":"/fr/blog/2023/03/23/v2.0.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"v1.6.0","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/02/25/v1.6.0"}},"content":"Docusaurus goes roar!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAfter all those years of JSDocs we have moved on to using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/)!\\n\\nThis will allow us to give much more information in a clear manner as well as giving a better introduction to what NodeCG is.\\nExpect to see the docs change a bit as we go through and make sure everything makes sense and looks good.\\n\\nDocs [GitHub](https://github.com/nodecg/docs)\\n\\n## Thanks to {#thanks}\\n\\n- Everyone on the NodeCG discord for testing\\n- [Ewan Lyon](https://github.com/EwanLyon)\\n- [Lange](https://github.com/Lange)\\n\\nfor making this update happen!"},{"id":"/2020/02/25/v1.6.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/02/25/v1.6.0","source":"@site/blog/2020-02-25-v1.6.0.md","title":"v1.6.0","description":"Minor version bump.","date":"2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"25 f\xe9vrier 2020","tags":[{"label":"update","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/update"},{"label":"v1.6.0","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/v-1-6-0"}],"readingTime":0.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ewan Lyon","url":"https://github.com/EwanLyon","imageURL":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19513845?s=460&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"v1.6.0","author":"Ewan Lyon","author_url":"https://github.com/EwanLyon","author_image_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19513845?s=460&v=4","tags":["update","v1.6.0"]},"prevItem":{"title":"New Docs!","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/02/26/New-Docs"}},"content":"Minor version bump.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## New {#new}\\n\\n- Docs now get automatically built _(old jsdocs)_\\n- Flexible mounts\\n- Expose NodeCG router\\n- p5.js Tutorial\\n\\n## Update {#update}\\n\\n- Docket now on Node 10\\n\\n## Fix {#fix}\\n\\n- Check if bundle package.json has version\\n- Typo in replicants description _(objcts \u2192 objects)_\\n- Clone replicant default value\\n\\n## Thanks to {#thanks}\\n\\n- [Seldszar](https://github.com/Seldszar)\\n- [Dan-Shields](https://github.com/Dan-Shields)\\n- [VodBox](https://github.com/VodBox)\\n- [Ewan Lyon](https://github.com/EwanLyon)\\n- [Hoishin](https://github.com/Hoishin)\\n- [Lange](https://github.com/Lange)\\n\\nfor making this update happen!\\n\\n**Version comparison [here](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0)**"}]}')}}]);
