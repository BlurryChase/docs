Docusaurus goes roar!

<!--truncate-->

After all those years of JSDocs we have moved on to using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/)!

This will allow us to give much more information in a clear manner as well as giving a better introduction to what NodeCG is.
Expect to see the docs change a bit as we go through and make sure everything makes sense and looks good.
